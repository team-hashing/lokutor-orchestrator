# Contributing to Lokutor Voice Agent

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. Ensure the test suite passes (`go test -v`)
4. Make sure your code lints
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/team-hashing/go-voice-agent/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/team-hashing/go-voice-agent/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** typically have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Run `go fmt` before committing
* Keep functions small and focused
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Add tests for new functionality
